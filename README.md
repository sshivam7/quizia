# Quizia: An Android Trivia Game

Quizia is an android trivia game that uses the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) to present a multiplayer quiz to users. 
The application makes use of the android shared preferences API in order to store game options such as level of difficulty or specific quiz categories. 
The data is then read and appended to a base url to fetch questions from the API. The requests in question are made using the volley library.
